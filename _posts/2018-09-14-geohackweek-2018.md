# Geohackweek 2018
*Sept. 2018*


At Geohackweek, our project team worked on [Topographic Influences on Snowmelt in a Warmer World](https://github.com/geohackweek/ghw2018_snowmelt) using raster snowdepth data derived from [NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170718004423/https://aso.jpl.nasa.gov/) lidar observations.
