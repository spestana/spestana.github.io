# Snow School
*Jan. 2018*

The [CUAHSI Snow Measurement Field School](https://www.cuahsi.org/education/training/training-and-workshops/snow-measurement-field-school) provides training for conducting snow hydrology fieldwork. In early January 2018, I attended snow shool at the [Fraser Experimental Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/fraser) in Colorado.

Two days were spent alternating between short classroom sessions, and practice in the field with various tools, observations, and measurement techniques. The third field day culminated in a simulated ground campaign, where my team sought to characterize the snowpack across a large area as if for validating microwave remote sensing measurements.
