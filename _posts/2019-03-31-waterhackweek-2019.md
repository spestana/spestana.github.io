# Waterhackweek 2019
*Mar. 2019*


At Waterhackweek, our project team worked python scripts to analyze raster snowdepth data derived from [NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO)](https://web.archive.org/web/20170718004423/https://aso.jpl.nasa.gov/) lidar observations, including clipping rasters using raster masks, and extracting snow depth values from discrete elevation bands using a reference DEM.
