# DSCOVR EPIC South-Up
*July 2021*

An invitation to challenge predominant spatial orientations and conventions, and in turn how we perceive the world.

This [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/dscovr_ebooks) displays animations of south-up oriented Earth images from the DSCOVR Earth Polychromatic Camera. Forked from [Russ Garrett's original DSCOVR EPIC bot](https://russ.garrett.co.uk/bots/dscovr_epic/), [@dscovr_epic](https://twitter.com/dscovr_epic)
