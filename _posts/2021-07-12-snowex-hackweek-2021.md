# SnowEx Hackweek 2021
*July 2021*

The first [SnowEx community hackweek](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/intro.html) was held in July 2021, a virtual event with participants from around the world. The week was structured into a series of [tutorials](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/tutorials/index.html) on how to use unique SnowEx datasets, models, and tools, followed by [team projects](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/projects/list_of_projects.html) to dive into different areas of interest related to snow science.

## Tutorials: Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing of Snow

I gave a tutorial on thermal infrared remote sensing of snow, and specifically how to use the airborne IR dataset collected during the [SnowEx 2020 field campaign](https://spestana.github.io/2020/02/snowex-2020/):

 * [Part 1: Comparing airborne IR imagery with ground-truth observationsÂ¶](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/tutorials/thermal-ir/thermal-ir-tutorial.html#part-1-comparing-airborne-ir-imagery-with-ground-truth-observations)
 * [Part 2: Satellite IR remote sensing obsevations](https://snowex-hackweek.github.io/website/tutorials/thermal-ir/thermal-ir-tutorial.html#part-2-satellite-ir-remote-sensing-obsevations)

## Project: Investigating SnowEx Temperature Observations at Grand Mesa, Colorado, Winter 2019-2020

I worked with the ["Hot Pow"](https://github.com/snowex-hackweek/hot-pow) project team to bring together all snow temperature observations for winter 2019-2020 at Grand Mesa, Colorado. These included thermal infrared imagery from aircraft and satellites, temperature measurements taken within snow pits, temperature observations from nearby meteorological stations, model and reanalysis data, and more. The goal of the project was for everyone to gain familiarity with these disparate data sources, and using open source (mostly python) computing tools to bring them together for visualization and analysis.

I think one of our greatest accomplishments as a team during the hackathon was that every team member was able to update our code repository on GitHub with their work!
