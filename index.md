# Hello world

Steven Pestana is a PhD student in the [Mountain Hydrology Research Group](https://depts.washington.edu/mtnhydr/) at the [University of Washington, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.ce.washington.edu/). His research interests include applying the unique perspective provided by remote sensing (whether from small UAS, aircraft, or satellites) to improve our understanding of mountain hydrology, seasonal snow, their patterns, and how they're changing.
