## About Me

I am a PhD student in the [Mountain Hydrology Research Group](https://depts.washington.edu/mtnhydr/) at the University of Washington in Seattly. My research interests include applying the unique perspective provided by remote sensing (whether from small UAS, aircraft, or satellites) to improve our understanding of mountain hydrology, seasonal snow, their patterns, and how they're changing.
